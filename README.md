## RONW.js
RONW.js is forked from roBrowser which is from [@MrAntares repo](https://github.com/MrAntares/Ragna.roBrowser) but we focus on putting it in NW.js to make it run on standalone as the original did.

## How to run it?
* You have to download the released 
* Copy the data.grf, rdata.grf, BGM,AI,System folders to the root of RONW.js
* edit the settings.js
* start RONW.exe

## Why did we choose NW.js?
The benefit of using NW.js is you can compile the source code to v8 Snapshot. That means you can protect your source code. You don't need to run the web server for this version because it will read directly from the Grf files, which means the speed of loading.

## Developer
If you want to pull the latest code and run from it, you need to install NW.js (We are using v0.70.1 SDK version) and edit the settings.js file save it and run `nw .` at the root folder.
